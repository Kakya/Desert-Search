<h2>Bird Hunt</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
2-D side-scrolling, flight game.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
To have fun maneuvering a plane in 2-D space.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
The game is a 2-D sidescroller.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
The player in this prototype can manipulate the plane to "Fly" in 2-D space by adjusting the "pitch" using angular acceleration and then applying thrust by adding horizontal velocity. Attempts to add autocannon fire and missiles have not been successful as of yet, but are planned to be in the game in the future. With those in, the enemy fighters can be added and the player can begin to dogfight. 

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
The ability to manipulate a plane in a semi-realistic avenue in 2-D space, in essence laying down the foundations for future dog-fighting scenarios.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The game has certain angular movements to allow for more plane-esque behavior while still remaining at its core a sidescroller.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game is set in an alternate history timeline in 2002, where the USSR and the US have been at war since 1989 over the status of a re-unified Germany. The player is given one of a new series of fighter jets (F-22s) that the US hopes to stem the tide of Soviet bombers entering NATO airspace. This fighter is, however, countered by Soviet S-37 Berkuts and the player must achieve air superiority by defeating the new Berkuts.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
The tension will entirely come from the gameplay tension, there isn't much of a story except for the backstory
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
All those who like fighter jets (Everyone that has ever existed. Ever. Including Augustus Caesar.) and side-scrolling games (See previous paranthetical).
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
In its half-completed state(still no enemy fighters), the game could be played endlessly.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
An effective strategy would be to remain at high-altitudes and dive upon enemy fighters as they appear. 
</li>

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I did not fork a specific Phaser game, but I made extensive use of the example physics modules for angular acceleration and velocity (to make the planes "pitch"). Similarly for music, used some of the modules to  help install music into the game.
