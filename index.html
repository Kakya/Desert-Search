<h2>Where's Jack?</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Crash-landed in a desert, you try to find your squad-mate, Jack.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
To search for Jack with the aid of the other survivors.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
The game is a top-down interactive narrative.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The player takes control of the soldier and guides him through the desert in hopes of finding his dearest chummy, Jack. To do so, the player must communicate with the other survivors.

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
The goal is to protoype dialogue trees and creating a brooding setting. Things aren't perfect with the dialogue just yet.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Branching dialogue (that sort of works)!
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
A transport plane crash lands somewhere in a desert and you're trying to see if your squad mate survived. There are other survivors scattered across that you may interact with.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
Find Jack. At all costs. You appear to be smaller than the other soldiers but no one notices and it would appear no one's heard of Jack. You have to keep searching, though.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
This game will hopefully appeal to the explorer who hopes to explore a new world.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
Until Jack is found, but unfortunately not all of that is implemented, the player could keep going until he encounters the general in this protoype.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
None that I know of as the game is not meant to be beaten per se. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Music is most definitely not mine: 
Intro: Sehnsucht-Rammstein
Background: Seemann-Rammstein
Soldier also not mine:

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I did not fork a specific Phaser game, but I made extensive use of the example physics modules.
