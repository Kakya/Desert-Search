<h2>Era of the Black Holes</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Keep your planet alive.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
To enjoy the tension of keeping the planet alive for as long as possible.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
The game is a top-down, avoid obstacle game.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The player takes control of the planet using the arrow keys and attempts to maneuver the planet amongst the black holes and avoid them for as long as possible. Any contact with a black-hole will lead to the death of the planet

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
The goal is to protoype collisions and death upon colliding with the black-holes.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Fun 2D manipulation of a planet and avoiding the black-holes.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
Far into the future of the universe, all will die. At the end, there is one astro-epoch hypothesized, called the Era of the Black Holes, a time when only black holes remain, sweeping up all the remaining mass in the universe. You are the God of this universe and have decided that this one planet is worth saving and want to keep it alive for as long as possible. Due to the black holes having eaten all the mass in the universe, there is nothing but darkness remaining.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
The game has no progressive story, only that you, the God would like to keep the planet alive.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Those with an interest in high-score achieving and in top-down games.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
As long as you can survive.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
To find a safe spot and remain there and move cautiously. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I did not fork a specific Phaser game, but I made extensive use of the example physics modules. Similarly for music, used some of the modules to  help install music into the game.
